# Github Finder ðŸ”Ž

This is a project where you can search for any GitHub user and explore their key projects along with relevant information such as stars, forks, and the primary programming language used. It marks my initial venture into TypeScript, during which I gained valuable experience with React Router DOM, enhancing my overall React skills.
